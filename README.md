Here you can find some basic hacks for the game "Saliens" which can be found on the steam store. Once the steam summer sale ends, these hacks won't be applicable anymore as the game would have been removed from steam. 

Please note that for these hacks to work they have to copy pasted into the console (hack 2 has to be copy pasted before the game starts). You can access the console by pressing F12 on chrome. 

Hope that this improves your gameplay experience :)
